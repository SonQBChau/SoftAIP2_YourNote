# Your Notes
Speech to text API with Annotation Mechanism

## Abstract

This project is about integrating an AI model into a mobile speech to text app, dubbed “Your Notes”, that can assist the user by summarizing lecture recordings, reducing the time you need to take study notes with. The user can input lecture recording as an audio file, and Your Notes will spit out the lecture summary in a bullet format. Additionally, the user will also be able to refer back to prior notes taken. Additional notes that “Your Notes” doesn’t capture can be manually added by the user. While the app is aimed at college students, this does not limit who can use its functions: for example, corporate employees can utilize this at professional meetings.
